It seems like it would be better not to unconditionally download certain
things.  How else should a script verify that it has the latest?  Maybe
there can be a maximum age on the image file, maybe a day.  Maybe the
same cache logic used by browsers could be used to obtain a new copy
only if it has changed since the timestamp on the existing file.
