- Magisk is (sometimes) unhappy about not being installed, whatever that
  means.
  - Might need to see unmodified boot to apply patching.

- Skip user interaction when installing twrp and superuser.
  x boot twrp image file
    - can be done from bootloader
    - may or may not initialize TWRP
      - not sure how initialization works
  o sideload the superuser zip file
    - still needs the user to hit "adb sideload"
    - sideload mode is a bit different from normal recovery mode
      - reboot may not be available
      - can we change state at all?

- Get rid of the aligned indentation.  It's horrible to try to read.

- Make restore of backups work reliably.  It likes to hang on certain
  applications.  Maybe we can skip them or something.
